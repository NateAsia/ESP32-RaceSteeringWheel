# Racing Steering Wheel

This repository contains the engineering design, implementation, and validation of a digital racing steering wheel for Formula Student style vehicles.

## Project Overview

The Racing Steering Wheel project aims to create a sophisticated, digital steering wheel for use in Formula Student competitions. It includes both hardware design and software implementation to provide a responsive and feature-rich interface for race car drivers.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains all source code for the project
  - `Steering Wheel/`: C++ code for the steering wheel microcontroller
  - `Car Emulator/`: Code for emulating car systems for testing
  - `GUI/`: Python code for the graphical user interface
- `electromechanical-design/`: Contains CAD files and other design documents
<!-- - `docs/`: Project documentation (if applicable) -->

## Steering Wheel Code

The steering wheel code is located in the `src/Steering Wheel` directory. It is written in C++ and designed for the ESP32-C3 or ESP32-S3 microcontroller. This code is responsible for:

- Reading inputs from various buttons and potentiometers on the steering wheel
- Managing the state of rotary encoders
- Sending data over CAN bus to the car's systems

### Key Components

- `SteeringWheel`: Main class that orchestrates all steering wheel operations
- `Button`: Manages individual button inputs
- `Potentiometer`: Handles analog inputs from potentiometers
- `RotaryButtonManager`: Manages the state and behavior of virtual rotary encoders (buttons that act as rotary encoders)
- `CANHandler`: Handles CAN bus communication

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
   - ESP32 board support package
   - Any additional libraries specified in the code

## Building and Flashing

1. Open the `steering_wheel_2024_code.ino` file in Arduino IDE or the project in PlatformIO
2. Select the appropriate board (ESP32-C3 or ESP32-S3)
    - Update the constants file to match your hardware setup
3. Build the project
4. Flash the compiled binary to your microcontroller

## Testing

- Use the Car Emulator code in `src/Car Emulator/` to simulate car systems for testing the steering wheel
    - This is programmed to work with the ESP32-C3 to help you view the CAN messages generated by the steering wheel system
- The GUI in `src/GUI/` can be used to visualize the steering wheel's state and inputs
